"""Goal: This Raspberry Pi will be connected to the TV in the research room.
    It will connect to our workflow management documents currently hosted in
    Google Sheets and will display current and historical research team
    performance information.

    It should update regularly (every 20-30 mins) so that the team is able to track their performance in
    (roughly) real-time.
